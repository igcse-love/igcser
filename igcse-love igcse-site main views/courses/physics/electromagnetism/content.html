    <h2 class="hidden offset">Magnetic Properties</h2>
    <p class="hidden offset">There are different types of metals with different magnetic properties. Only a few metals are magnetic and some are better suited for making a typical magnet.</p>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">Magnetic Materials</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">Magnetic materials can be attracted by magnets but not repelled. Magnetic hardness is a measure of how easily a magnetic material can be magnetised. Iron is magnetically soft while steel is hard. This means it is harder to change the magnetic field of steel objects.</p>
    <ul class="hidden offset">
      <li>Iron (Ferrous)</li>
      <li>Cobalt</li>
      <li>Nickel</li>
    </ul>

      <div class="note">
        Steel is an alloy of iron. Alloys can inherit some properties like magnetism. Alloys containing iron are called ferrous. 
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">Permanent Magnets</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">Permanent magnets last a long time like typical bar magnets, horseshoe magnets, and refrigerator magnets. They are harder to magnetise and demagnetise. It is important to remember that the magnetic field flows from <strong>north to south</strong>!</p>
    <ul class="hidden offset">
      <li>Hard Magnetic Material (Steel)</li>
      <li>North Pole & South Pole</li>
      <li>Attract & Repel</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">Electromagnets</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">Electromagnets are usually temporary magnets made by passing electricity through a coil.</p>
    <ul class="hidden offset">
      <li>Soft Magnetic Core (Iron)</li>
      <li>North Pole & South Pole</li>
      <li>Attract & Repel</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="callout hidden small">

        ðŸ¤”
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        Only <strong>direct current</strong> can be used to make electromagnets because the field lines constantly change in alternating current. 
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="hidden offset">Grip Rule</h2>
    <p class="hidden offset">The right-hand grip rule is used to determine the rotation of a magnetic field produced by a current flowing through a wire. The thumb points in the direction of the current while the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field. Solenoids follow this rule as well.</p>

    <h2 class="hidden offset">Fleming's Hand Rules</h2>
    <div class="callout hidden small">
      <div class="emoji-container">

      </div>
      <div class="note">
        Some people prefer to use the right-hand slap rule over Fleming's left-hand rule because it is very similar to the grip rule.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="hidden offset">Fleming's hand rules are used to determine the relative directions of a current, force, and magnetic field. Fleming's left-hand rule applies to situations where a force is being produced by a current. Fleming's right-hand rule applies to situations where a current is being produced by a force. In both cases, the thumb is the force, the index finger is the magnetic field, and the middle finger is the direction of the current.</p>

      <div class="note">
        The motor effect is more commonly asked than the generator effect. However, it is crucial to know the applications of both hand rules.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">DC Motor</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">The left-hand rule says the direction of the force is upwards if the magnetic field is pointing forward and the current is flowing to the right. This is Fleming's left-hand rule.</p>
    <div class="diagram hidden">
      <img src="%{ path }%images/dc motor.png" alt="dc motor">
    </div>
    <p class="hidden offset">The DC motor in the diagram would alternate between half clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations due to the lack of a commutator. A split ring commutator ensures that the motor will always spin in the same direction.</p>
    <div class="diagram hidden">
      <img src="%{ path }%images/commutators.png" alt="dc motor with commutator">
    </div>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">AC Generator</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">The current flows left instead of right in Fleming's right-hand rule. This is because kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy.</p>
    <p class="hidden offset">AC generators have 2 slip ring commutators to ensure that the coil remains connected to the circuit.</p>
    <h2 class="hidden offset">Types of Currents</h2>
    <p class="hidden offset">There are two types of currents.</p>
    <ul class="hidden offset">
      <li><strong>Direct Current</strong>: a current with a constant voltage that remains in the same direction</li>
      <li><strong>Alternating Current</strong>: a current with a varying voltage (sinusoidal wave) that changes direction</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="hidden offset">Alternating current is used to transport electricity at long distances while direct current is used to power small devices.</p>

    <h2 class="hidden offset">Induction</h2>
    <p class="hidden offset">Electromagnetic induction occurs when a conductive coil cuts a magnetic field and induces a potential difference. This causes current to flow.</p>
    <div class="callout hidden small">

      </div>
      <div class="note">
        The words, <strong>"induce"</strong> and <strong>"induction"</strong>, are keywords in mark schemes.
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">Solenoids</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">Solenoids are circular coils of wire. They look like a hollow cylinder with multiple loops. Magnetic cores can be placed inside solenoids to create electrogmagnets. This is because the magnetic field created by a solenoid is similar to a bar magnet.</p>
    <p class="hidden offset">There is an experiment that involves oscillating a bar magnet in and out of a solenoid. The movement of the bar magnet produces alternating voltage.</p>
    <ul class="hidden offset">
      <li>The solenoid cuts the magnetic field of the magnet and indcues a voltage</li>
      <li>The voltage is reversed when the magnet changes direction and alternating current is produced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="hidden offset">Transformers</h2>
    <p class="hidden offset">These are not robots. Transformers are devices that increase (step-up) voltage or decrease (step-down) voltage. The side with the most coils would have a higher voltage. In theory, transformers are 100% efficient. This means that the output voltage is directly proportional to the number of coils.</p>
    <div class="diagram hidden">
      <img src="%{ path }%images/transformer.png" alt="step-down transformer">
    </div>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">Transformer Coil Equation</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">The variable \( V_p \) represents the primary input voltage while \( N_s \) represents the secondary output number of coils. The ratio of the voltages is equal to the ratio of the coils.</p>
    <p class="hidden katex-display">
      \( \frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} \)
    </p>
    <h3 class="hidden offset">Transformer Power Equation</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">Another transformer equation involves power. The input power is equal to the output power. However, high voltage and low current is used to transfer electricity across long distances to reduce power loss.</p>
    <p class="hidden katex-display">
      \(
      P_p = P_s \\
      V_p \times I_p = V_s \times I_s
      \)
    </p>
    <ul class="hidden offset">
      <li>
        High voltages decrease power loss because power loss is calculated as \( I^2 \times R \)
      </li>
      <li>A smaller current is safer to work with</li>
    </ul>
