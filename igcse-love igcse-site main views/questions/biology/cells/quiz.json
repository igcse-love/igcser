      "difficulty": 3,
      "options": [
        "The cell has no nucleus to use up oxygen.",
        "The cell membrane has a small surface area in relation to volume.",

        "The flat structure makes it easier to be carried through arteries."
      ],
      "scheme": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is: The cytoplasm contains haemoglobin. \nBlood cells carry oxygen to different parts of the body. Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration in organs. Red blood cells can transport oxygen around the body because oxygen binds to haemoglobin. These cells do not have nuclei to allow room for haemoglobin. \nRed blood cells have a biconcave shape to maximise the efficiency oxygen absorption. A biconcave shape increases the surface area in relation to volume."

      ],
      "scheme": 3,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is: mitochondria and ribosomes. \nEnzymes are proteins and ribosomes are responsible for making proteins. This means that the salivary glands need a large number of ribosomes to produce salivary amylase. Mitochondria release energy through aerobic respiration. A lot of energy is required to manufacture proteins. \nMost cells only have one nucleus. Vacuoles are rarely seen in animal cells and plant cells typically only have a single vacuole."

      "scheme": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is: nucleus and vacuole. \nThe nucleus and vacuole are the largest structures of the cell and can be easily seen under a light microscope. \nRibosomes are too small and require an electron microscope for viewing. \nChloroplasts are found in cells that can phtotosynthesise. Root hair cells do not have chloroplasts."

        "Plants are supported by osmosis filling the cell membrane with water, increasing the strength of the cell."
      ],
      "scheme": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is: Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. \nPlant cells become turgid when placed in a hypotonic solution because water enters the cell via osmosis. The plant cell swells with water but does not burst due to the cell wall. The turgor pressure created by the water keeps the plant cell stiff."
