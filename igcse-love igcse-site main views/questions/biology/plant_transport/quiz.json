      ],
      "scheme": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is: provide a large surface area, maximising the rate of absorption of water by osmosis and ions by active transport. \nA large surface area helps the roots absorb more water and nutrients at a time. Water is absorbed through osmosis because there is usually a lower water potential in the soil. Mineral ions are absorbed through active transport because there is a usually a higher concentation of ions in the cell than the soil."
